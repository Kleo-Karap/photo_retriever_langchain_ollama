# Practical AI Meetup #2
This repository contains the codebase and resources from Meetup #1, enabling attendees and the broader community to explore, experiment, and expand upon the concepts presented.

Feel free to dive into the code, modify it, and see AI in action! Your contributions and feedback are always welcome.

Let's make AI practical, together.

# Instructions
You can walk through the notebook to grasp the key concepts. The trickiest part is installing Ollama in the CLI, but you should have no problem with that.

Having a GPU will speed up the photo processing.

Enjoy!
